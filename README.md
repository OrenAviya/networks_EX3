TCP – Congestion Control Algorithms 
Network programming in C

In this Ex you’ll write two program files:

Sender.py and Receiver.py. The Sender will send a file and the Receiver will receive it and measure the time it took for his program to receive the file.
The file will be sent in two parts (first half and second half [Each half should be 50% of the file]) each half will be sent according to one of the CC algorithms you learned in the lectures.
You are obligated to send the file a few times (at least 5 times in each run) for creating data set (What is a data set and what it’s the purpose when you developing a program or an Algorithm? Great question! We believe in you. You can find the answer by yourself).
You are obligated to run the program with a packet lost tool in the following levels:
0% lost, 10% lost, 15% lost, 20% lost.
